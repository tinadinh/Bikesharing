# Bikesharing
## Overview of the analysis
This analysis is a visualization of New York Citi Bike data (August 2019) in order to explore the viability of a bike-sharing business using data visualization tools.The purpose is to see if the bike rental business is worth investing in for a different city. One of the key factors we need to look at is trip duration. Finding out how long the trips are in the month of August. Thus, it will give us a good analysis on when the bikes are rented, how long they are rented and what times are the most popular times to rent a bike. \

I discovered by using the tableau and creating 7 different visulizations with the total number of trips, the types of users and the trip duration:
- There was a total of 2,344,224 trips in the month of August.
- From the total trips 1,900,359 users subscribe to the company and 443,865 users are customers.
- There is a peak number of users who rent their bike for 5-6 hour trips.
- The largest number of individuals happen to be male, the women users dont have as large of a peak and unkown users do not have a peak for tripduration.
- If you look at my trips per weekday(by hour) you can see that Thursday between 5pm-7pm is the most popular time to ride a bike.

## Summary
Visualizations were created to show the length of time the bikes are checkout for all riders and genders, show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week, show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week, top starting locations, and top ending locations. I realized in this tableau, the most usage occurred on Thursdays and starting and ending locations of Citibike trips were the same. In order to start the bikeshare business in a different city for our customer, additional visualizarions are needed in order to determine if Citibikes is a great fit for Des Moines, Iowa because we are only just looking at one month. One visulization that may help determine if Citibikes are a good fit, if we were to look at the colder months in the city to see how many riders we have in November/December so that customers can prepare for those months. Another visualization I would suggest is to get the average distance between customers home location and the bike renting location which would allow the customer to adjust for potential biker locations.
